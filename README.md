A map-based web application that serves as an interactive multimedia platform for illustrating the experiences of migrants, created by Farimah Karimi.\
The characters and events illustrated in this app are fictional and were created for demonstrative purposes.

Node.js is required to run the app locally.\
See [https://nodejs.org/en/learn/getting-started/how-to-install-nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en/learn/getting-started/how-to-install-nodejs) for more information.

After installing Node.js, run `npm ci` in the project directory to install the required packages.

To run the the app in the development mode, run `npm start` in the project directory.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.


Approach

The project will be implemented in several steps:

1. Project Planning and Structuring
        Define the objectives and core features (e.g. timeline displays, quiz modules, interactive maps)
        To finalize this step we will meet with Farimah
        Set up a project structure with directories for data, code, and results.
2. Data Preparation
        Collect and organize the data about characters, routes, and events.
        Address legal aspects when using external data sources.
3. Application Development
        Initialize the project with Node.js and required libraries (e.g., React, Leaflet for maps)
        Implement interactive features:
            Timeline visualizations
            Info panels about cultural and historical locations
            Quiz modules
